Hi! My name is Khaleb Denham, and this is my first post on my website. I did some research into what I wanted to use to host my website, and decided to use Jekyll and Ruby. I am hosting it through Github pages. Currently, I work as an Automated Support Associate for Walmart's Automated Fulfillment department. I started working there in 2022, after having parted from my position at Verizon. I have obtained many useful skills during my time in this role. Some of these include: Proactive troubleshooting, hands-on technician work, Electrical work using motherboards and industrial electrical equipment, and working in confined spaces. 

My job has many different responsibilities. I started off with a solid foundation of knowledge about the functions of the Online Pickup & Receiving department, which translated directly into the more advanced work with the robots. As I was learning this position, I was also working to better myself beyond my Associate's degree in Computer Sciences. This was in the form of a set of Full-Stack web development bootcamps that equated to about 600 hours of programming time over the span of 16 months. This is where I gained most my expereience with Java, JavaScript, Python, CSS, React, Bootstrap, and a small few other languages and repositories. I was able to build a few small projects and applications. A CRUD operations-compliant web page with multiple pages. A database using Maven tools with javascript. A few web games like Tic-tac-toe. This webpage will likely be my most coherent assembly of information. At least, what I will try to use as a visible repository for any major future projects, or anything I want to show off.

I want to make a game. I will likely showcase progress on that goal on this site, as it occurs. I will keep my personal opinions on the outer world minimal, and I will not include my personal life into these logs. 

Thank you for your time,


Khaleb
